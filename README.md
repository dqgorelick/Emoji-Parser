##DESCRIPTION:

Currently there is no standardized way of interpretting emojis. Emojis are frequently used in text messages to represent a sentiment, but that exact sentiment can sometimes be ambiguous. We plan on making our own language to explore the application of emojis in natural language.

Type checking/Error message (Incorrect Syntax Error)
Still working this out, if you have any ideas?

##OTHER COMPONENTS:

We are creating an interpreter but are not sure how to integreate the compiler/optimization part of the project

##BACKEND TECHNOLOGIES:

    -Twilio API endpoint
    -Node.js server
    -hosting HTML site (maybe)
    -serverside services
